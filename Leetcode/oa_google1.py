given string A (which contains M strings delimited by ',') 
and string B (which contains N strings delimited by ','),
 returns an array C of N integers.
 For 0 â‰¤ J < N, values of C[J] specify the number of strings in A which are strictly smaller than the comparison J-th string in B (starting from 0).
A = "abcd,aabc,bd" B = "aaa,aa" op:[3,2]
